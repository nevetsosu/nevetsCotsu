Next steps:
     switch youtube downloader to YoutubeExplode for getting youtube streams, only requires one FFMPEG for volume normalization and volume control 
     consider switching ffmpeg to local code
     performance tuning
     passthrough docker health checks to ec2 auto scale
     lyrics command (requires new API)


For Later:
go through and consider what should be exception and what should be return (through regular validation check)
make the queue paged (figure out how to change the pages based on reaction)
